# Client Deployment

This directory contains extra deployment config files critical for running the
Deriva Flow Clinet.

### Client Config

The ``cfde_client_config.json`` file lists the global configuration each user
will pull from when running the Deriva Flow Client tool. The config exists on a
public globus endpoint and is used by each client regardless of version.

Current Deployment exists on the GCS CFDE Prod endpoint
